# GPA_ML_Regression

In this project, we will analyze a dataset on student performance. We will address questions such as:

How does weekly study time influence students' GPA?
This question aims to explore whether there is a correlation between the amount of time students spend studying each week and their academic performance measured by GPA.

Is there a relationship between parents' educational level and students' academic performance?
Here, we could investigate whether students whose parents have a higher educational level tend to achieve better grades.

How do absences affect students' final grades?
This question seeks to explore whether there is a relationship between the number of absences a student has and their academic performance.

Does parental support have a significant impact on academic performance?
You could analyze whether students who receive more support from their parents perform better in school.

Is participation in extracurricular activities (sports, music, volunteering) associated with better academic performance?
This question examines whether participation in extracurricular activities has a positive influence on students' GPA.

Are there significant differences in academic performance based on gender or ethnicity?
You could explore whether there are disparities in students' grades based on their gender or ethnicity.

The goal of this project is to predict students' academic performance based on various sociodemographic and educational factors. By using machine learning algorithms, we aim to identify key patterns that influence academic success or underperformance.

Academic performance is a key indicator of student success and can be influenced by various factors such as age, study time, participation in extracurricular activities, and family support, among others. Through this project, we aim to apply predictive analysis techniques to provide recommendations and insights that help teachers and parents optimize educational strategies.

The main objective is to build a classification model that can predict the academic performance class (GPA) of a student based on the available features in the dataset.
